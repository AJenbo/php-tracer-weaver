php-tracer-weaver
===

**php-tracer-weaver** is a tool for analysing parameter types in PHP code, using a combination of static and runtime analysis. It relies on the [xdebug extension](http://www.xdebug.org/docs/execution_trace) to trace function calls.

The project consists of two main tools:

* trace.sh
* weave.php

trace.sh
---

This is just a wrapper around php + xdebug. Use it in lieu of `php` to execute a php script. It will run normally, but the code is traced and the output is dumped in `dumpfile.xt`. You can also mnually configure xdebug to generate the dumpfile.

Sample usage:

    trace.sh test.php

weave.php
---

This tool takes a dumpfile (Generated by trace.sh) and a php-source file, and injects docblock comments into the php-source, using the type-information from the trace. The tool expects `dumpfile.xt` in the current directory, and takes the file to weave with as argument, printing the modified file to stdout. You can pipe it back to the input file, if you want to actually modify your code.

Sample usage:

    weave.php somelibrary.php > somelibrary.php

The same dumpfile can be used to weave multiple files, by calling `weave.php` for each.
